# CSS - Digital Clock

This is a simple digital clock coded with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It's is my personal version of the [original project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK0ok3ZCXwM&list=PLGTK_wPcnd_o2968V2gSU5EszKBO3ffYc&index=1&t=457s) from the YouTube channel [Matheus Battisti - Hora de Codar](https://www.youtube.com/@larissakich).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

- How to make my own HTML snippet. A shortcut to the HTML <!DOCTYPE>.

- 8 Digits hex color.
  >The last two ones are for the alpha channel (transparency).

- Change multiple occurencies.
  > `cmd` + Keep pressing `d`

- Copy a line without selecting it entirely.
  >Just place the cursor in the line and press `cmd` + `c`.

- Refined the favicon part of the <!DOCTYPE> HTML snippet.

### Continued development

- Concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with:
  - Javascript

- Techniques I want to refine and perfect:
  - The CSS property `box-shadow`

### Useful resources

  - [HTML shortcuts](https://dev.to/hannahgooding/vs-code-shortcuts-and-tricks-that-i-wish-i-knew-sooner-3mcj) - This helped me to create my own HTML shortcut for <!DOCTYPE>.

  - [CSS 8 Digit Hex Colors](https://www.quackit.com/css/color/values/css_hex_color_notation_8_digits.cfm#:~:text=Eight%2Ddigit%20hex%20notation%20consists,alpha%20chanel%20of%20the%20color.&text=The%20RR%20represents%20the%20red,GG%20represents%20the%20green%20component.) - This taught me that hex color codes can have 8 digits.
